# Welcome to Outliner ðŸ‘‹

Outliner is a note-taking app, like a lot of others.

## Why does this project exist?

In the early months of 2023 I was using logseq and syncthing. It was a good setup, but the company that
I was working for had a RIF. I knew the meeting that would announce who was laid-off would be happening
in 15 minutes.

I keep a lot of notes, some of them very personal, and I didn't want someone in IT to have access to
all of them. So I started deleting files like an embassy had fallen.

Now, I don't plan on repeating that again. I'm creating outliner to allow self hosting a web interface,
and provide offline-first client applications. That way I can use it on my personal computer while I'm
offline, and run it on my raspberry pi server where I can get to it from my work computer.
